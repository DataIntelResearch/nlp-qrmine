# How to setup readthedocs

* Add the readthedocs.yaml config file. This has precedence over advanced settings on the web interface. The name can be:
	* readthedocs.yml
	* readthedocs.yaml
	* .readthedocs.yml
	* .readthedocs.yaml

(This is not added as the default settings on advanced tab are the same)

```
# .readthedocs.yml / 
# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for details

# Required
version: 2

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/conf.py

# Build documentation with MkDocs
#mkdocs:
#  configuration: mkdocs.yml

# Optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF and ePub
formats: all

# Optionally set the version of Python and requirements required to build your docs
python:
  version: 3.7
  install:
    - requirements: docs/requirements.txt

```

* the configuration is in the docs/conf.py (This is autogenerated by pyscaffold)

* Add recommonmark extension to docs/conf.py to add support for markdown

* See how source_suffix and master_doc are added to docs/conf.py 

* The master doc is index.rst (Check the file for creating table of contents. You can combine markdown and rst)

* See the line *Module Reference <api/modules>* in index.rst. This will be automatically populated by documentation from modules by the sphinx.ext.autodoc. This module is configured to use the api folder in the conf.py file.
